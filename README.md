# Helidon Assistant

Helidon Assistant is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built around Helidon's documentation. It provides a friendly AI chat interface to help answer Helidon-related questions.

Key Features:

- **Smart AsciiDoc Processing**: Special handling of AsciiDoc content during embedding creation, including:
    - Clean conversion to plain text.
    - Grouping by document sections.
    - Preserving code snippets and tables as meaningful units.
- **Metadata Preservation**: Embeddings retain rich metadata such as:
    - Document name.
    - Section and position within the document.
- **Stateless Backend**: Conversations are summarized on the server and stored client-side for a lightweight, scalable experience.
